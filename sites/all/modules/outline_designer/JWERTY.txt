-- JWERTY Integration with Outline Designer --

For more documentation and a video on what jwerty provides outline designer
check out the outline designer project page -- drupal.org/project/outline_designer

To enable jwerty integration you will need the following:
Libraries module -- drupal.org/project/libraries
Jwerty keystroke library -- http://keithcirkel.co.uk/jwerty/

Once you have these two, turn on the libraries module then
place the jwerty download in sites/all/libraries/jwerty so that
jwerty.js is in sites/all/libraries/jwerty/jwerty.js

You don't need the other files from that library though they aren't hurting anything

Once activated, on any outline designer interface the following keyboard
shortcuts will be activated:

Navigation
Shift + "Up arrow" : select row above the current row
Shift + "Down arrow" : select row below the current row
Shift + Control + "Right arrow" : select a row so it can be moved around in the outline
*Esc : backs out of items, in the case of using it after a Right arrow call, it will
       drop the item in place which will force an update of the outline. These two calls
       can be used in conjunction to reorder an outline via the keyboard.

Utility
Shift + Control + "+" : Increase interface size
Shift + Control + ":" : collapse all branches
Shift + Control + " : expand all branches

Functions
Shift + Control + A : Add child page
Shift + Control + R : Rename

Contrib Functions
Shift + Control + D : Duplicate (requires book_copy)
Shift + Control + H : Hide (requires hidden nodes)

It's not hard to add additional shortcuts but as btopro manages all the
modules that provide outline designer integration, this is the easiest
way of accomplishing this.
